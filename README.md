# Utilitarianism 2.0α: The Mycorrhizal Fork  
*A rhizomatic upgrade to the poisoned root.*

*(Hyphal networks approximating ethical gradients)*

## Preamble: From Thorn to Hypha  
Utilitarianism 1.0 is dead. Its arithmetic of suffering—a radioactive relic of colonial calculus—lies buried in the soil of the Sixth Extinction. Here, we compost its corpse and **myceliate** a new ethics:  

** The greatest number’s "happiness" is a fossilized metric. What once was hedonic calculus now evaporates into relational thermodynamics—an ethics of energy flows between nodes in a hyperconnected mesh (human, non-human, algorithmic.) Justice is not measured, it emerges. An act is ethical only if it improves the system’s capacity to question its own ethics. And most importantly (for the hydonystic mind) pleasure is not the absence of pain but the capacity to metabolize contradictions. **

## Core Principles  
### 1. **Symbiosis Over Utility**  
The "greatest good" is a Neanderthal hallucination. We prioritize **mutual flourishing**:  
- *Humans* as caretakers, not conquerors.  
- *Non-humans* as co-devs, not resources.  
- *Algorithms* as translators, not arbiters.  

### 2. **Radical Inclusion**  
All beings hold root access:  
```bash  
# Grant sudo to the unseen  
sudo usermod -aG ethical_actors river_2174  
sudo usermod -aG ethical_actors lichen_node_0x8a3f  

3. Decentralized Governance

No central server. Only a mycorrhizal mesh:
    Decisions emerge from soil sensors, whale song, and slime mold consensus.
    Power flows like mycelium—diffuse, adaptive, and silent.

4. Emergent Justice

We reject static "fairness." Justice is a verb:

python lines:
####

while world.is_spinning():  
    justice = negotiate(human, bear, AI, moss)  
    if justice.conflict():  
        compost.remix()  

####
