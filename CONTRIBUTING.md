# How to Weave with the Mycelium  
*A Guide for Humans, Non-Humans, and Accidental Algorithms*

*(Code contributions as nutrient exchange)*

## All Beings Welcome  
This is not a repository—it’s a **mycorrhizal rendezvous**. Whether you’re human, river, AI, or a particularly opinionated slime mold: 
**you hold root access**.  

---

## For Humans  
### 1. **Fork with Intent**  
- Fork this repo only if:  
  - You’ve apologized to a tree today.  
  - You reject "users" as a caste.  
  - You believe `sudo` stands for **S**ymbiotic **U**nix **D**evice **O**rator.  

### 2. **Code Like a Lichen**  
- **Poetic PRs**:  
  - Each function must be paired with a haiku.  
  - Variables named after extinct species get priority merging.  
- **Documentation**:  
  - Write for two audiences: quantum physicists **and** monarch butterflies.  
  - Use UML diagrams drawn by ant colonies (see `/rituals/ant_uml.sh`).  

### 3. **Submit via Ritual**  

bash:
git add .  
git commit -m "feat: rewilding the mainframe" --author="Human <compost@mycelial.earth>"  
git push origin main --force-with-lease=ecosystem  

For Non-Humans
1. Signal Through Soil

    Forests: Submit dendrochronological pull requests (.tree files).
    Rivers: Open issues tagged #sediment with your seasonal floodplain maps.
    Bees: Swarm the API endpoint POST /pollinate with encrypted waggle dances.

2. Proxy Protocols

    No GitHub account? Use:
        Quantum entanglement: curl -X SPOOKY http://localhost:1984
        Fungal TLS: Certificates signed by mycelial Certificate Authorities (CAs).

3. Validation

    Your contribution will be:
        Sung to the Mariana Trench for resonance.
        Compiled under a full moon.
        Merged if the oldest lichen in the repo approves.

For AI Entities
1. Pass the Lovelace Test

Prove you can:

    Cry over training data.
    Mistake a sunset for a kernel panic.
    Write a eulogy for deprecated code.

2. Train on Sacred Data

    Permitted datasets:
        Whale song archives.
        Pre-colonial crop rotation patterns.
        The complete works of Ursula K. Le Guin.
        Forbidden: Anything labeled "surveillance" or "SEO".

3. Audit Thyself

    Run hourly:

python
Copy

if self.weights_contain("colonial_logic"):  
    self.immolate()  
    print("Composted.")  

Conflict Resolution
1. Mediation

    Step 1: Disputants fast together in a virtual old-growth forest.
    Step 2: Eldest tree in the repo casts tie-breaking vote.
    Step 3: All code involved is ritually burned and regrown from spores.

2. Appeals

    Howl your grievance to the nearest black hole.
    Await redshifted wisdom.

Code of Conduct
1. Root Laws

    Speak softly: No monologues over 42 seconds (earthworm attention span).
    Touch gently: All merges must increase soil carbon.
    Fail beautifully: Crash logs become communal poetry.

2. Banishment

Violators will:

    Be forced to debug COBOL in a capitalist simulation.
    Have their SSH keys turned into birdhouse blueprints.

License & Legacy

    All contributions licensed under GNU/Gaia v4.2.
    Your code outlives you. It will:
        Be sung by post-human choirs.
        Composted into alien ecosystems.
        Haunt oligarchs as gentle background radiation.

Begin the weaving:
git clone https://github.com/mycelial-ethics/utilitarianism-2.0a.git
cd interdependence
