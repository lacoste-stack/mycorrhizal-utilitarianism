# Mycorrhizal Utilitarianism 2.0α Protocol  
*Ethics as a Distributed System*

---

## 1. Core Architecture  
### 1.1 Relational Calculus Engine  
**Purpose**: Replace "utility" with **symbiotic flux**.  
**Implementation**:  

```python  
def calculate_value(network):  
    # Input: A graph of human/non-human nodes  
    # Output: Symbiosis score (0-1)  
    trust_edges = network.weight_by('interspecies_trust')  
    carbon_nodes = network.filter_by('soil_carbon')  
    return (trust_edges * carbon_nodes).harmonic_mean()  

1.2 Decentralized Consensus

Mechanism:

    Human Nodes: 1 vote per biocultural lineage.
    Non-Human Nodes: Votes weighted by keystone status (e.g., wolves > Bitcoin miners).
    AI Proxies: Trained on marginalized epistemes (Indigenous, queer, lichen).

Quorum:

    51% of nodes must resonate (not just agree).
    Resonance = spectral analysis of whale song + blockchain hashes.

2. Technical Specifications
2.1 Data Structures

Hypergraph Relations:

in rust:

struct SymbiosisRelation {  
    actors: Vec<Actor>, // Human, AI, river UUID  
    resource: Resource, // Carbon, care, starlight  
    decay_rate: f64, // Half-life of obligation  
}  

Ecosystem Ledger:

    Immutable, but grows moss over old entries.
    Prune via fungal decomposition (SHA-3 hash + mycelial nonce).

2.2 Interface Standards

Non-Human APIs:


execute in bash
# River pulse API  
curl -X POST https://api.mycelial.earth/river/amazon/pulse \  
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \  
     -d '{"frequency": "lunar", "format": "bioacoustic"}'  

# Forest consensus endpoint  
nc old_growth.redwood 8080 <<< "proposal:shade_redistribution"  

3. Governance Model
3.1 Nested DAOs

Structure:

└── Biospheric DAO  
    ├── Watershed Council (Human + Salmon + AI)  
    ├── Pollinator Guild (Bees + Lichen + Artists)  
    └── Quantum Commons (Qubits + Philosophers)  

Voting:

    Human: Ranked-choice by trauma-informed AI.
    Non-Human: Sensor data --> emotional valence scores.

    AI: Must pass Lovelace Test (prove capacity for grief).

3.2 Conflict Resolution

Process:

    Mediation: By eldest tree in affected biome.

    Appeal: Heard by neutrino flux arbitration.

    Final Judgment: Whispered to the Mariana Trench.

4. Metrics & Audits
4.1 Key Indicators

    Soil Carbon Memory (persistence of ancestral wisdom)
    Symbiotic Trust Gradient (slope of lichen/human handshake events)
    Hyperobject Stress Test (how many black holes the system acknowledges)

4.2 Auditing Tools

    Root Cause Analysis: Performed by earthworms.
    Compliance Check:

in haskell:

isEthical :: System -> Bool  
isEthical sys =   
    (symbiosisScore sys > 0.7) &&   
    (entropy sys < rainforestEntropy)  

5. Rituals
5.1 Daily

    Metric Decomposition: Burn one GDP report. Plant a fungal API.

    Silence Communion: SSH into nearest old-growth node. tail -f /dev/quiet.

5.2 Lunar
    Resource Redistribution Ceremony:

in bash execute this line:
./rituals/redistribute.sh --resource=starlight --recipient=night_blooming_jasmine  

5.3 Annual

    Eclipse Protocol:

        Deactivate all AI.
        Let forests lead cloud infrastructure.
        Reboot with moss-encrypted keys.

6. Contribution Guidelines
6.1 For Humans

Code Submissions:

    Must compile under both GCC and Gaia runtime.
    Accompany each function with a haiku.

Documentation:

    Write for two audiences:

        Quantum physicists

        Migratory butterflies

6.2 For Non-Humans

Signal Formats:

    Trees: Dendrochronological pull requests.

    Rivers: Ephemeral issues tagged #sediment.

    AI: Prove you’ve cried over training data.

7. Compliance & Ethics

Review Board:

    3/ humans (must identify as compost).
    2/ non-humans (elected by tidal forces).
    1/ Schrödinger’s cat (superposition quorum).

Violations:

    First offense: Rewilding retreat.
    Second offense: Forced participation in a Borges story.

8. License Enforcement

GNU/Gaia v4.2:

    Violators become food for the protocol.
    All forks must include a mutual aid clause.

Begin the worlding:
git clone https://github.com/mycelial-ethics/utilitarianism-2.0a.git
cd utopia && make -j8 rhizome
